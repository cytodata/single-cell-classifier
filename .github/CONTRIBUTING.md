# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for investing the time to contribute!

The CytoData 2019 Hackathon focused on developing solutions to classify mechanism-of-action (MOA) phenotypes in single cells.
We used images and image-based profiles to determine MOA.

The following document contains a set of guidelines for how to best contribute to the analytical code base.

## Project Goals

### Mission Statement

We strive to foster a welcoming environment (see [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)), where participants are encouraged to learn new things and exchange ideas freely.

### Scientific Goals

The project has three primary goals:

1. Determine the extent to which single cells can be classified by their mechanism of action (MOA).
2. Compare profiling strategies to generate biological representations of single cell morphologies.
3. Everyone learns something new.

## Open Science

We will pursue this project using [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
Be aware that any code added to this repository will be posted under a [CC-BY-4.0 International License](LICENSE.md).

## Pull Request Model

We will be operating under a pull request model.
Please refer to [this guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) explaining how forking and branching works under such a model.

The best pull requests consist of:

1. Adding or updating a single feature
2. Clear and concise description of the change
3. A confirmation that the entire analysis still runs
4. Fully ["linted"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) code.

A pull request template is provided in the [`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

We are friendly people!
Do not hesitate to ask for help reviewing code and or creating a pull request!

## Code Review

The only way code can be accepted and merged into the repository is after a thorough code review by _one_ other member familiar with
the code base.

## Style

Our goal is to have readable, concise, and working code.

We follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for python and [Google's style guide for R](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml).

Code can be quickly made to follow style guides by a linter (e.g. [Flake8](https://atom.io/packages/linter-flake8)) or by [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
Please make sure code style is updated prior to code review.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Many exploratory analyses are conducted using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).
When adding a notebook to the repository, please also add a corresponding `.py` file.

The corresponding `.py` file is autogenerated with [`nbconvert`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Specially, perform the following command in the directory where the notebook is saved.

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to=script --FilesWriter.build_directory=scripts/nbconverted *.ipynb
```

This will convert any `.ipynb` file in the directory to `.py` files, and place the `.py` files in the `scripts/nbconverted/` folder.
`.py` files are easier to review on github, and easier to determine exactly what code changes.

**Important Note:** Do not apply `black` to any autogenerated file, including jupyter notebooks.

## Code of Conduct

This is described in the [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) document.
